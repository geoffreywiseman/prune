In a future release, I expect to package prune as a gem, but there are a few things preventing me from doing that right now, notably the retention policy not having been externalized in any way. In the interim, prune is available as a [Zip archive](https://github.com/geoffreywiseman/prune/zipball/master), a [Tarball](https://github.com/geoffreywiseman/prune/tarball/master) or [directly through GitHub](http://github.com/geoffreywiseman/prune), all visible in the banner above.
