title: "Prune: Configure"
---
Prune is designed to maintain a file tree, pruning files by removing and archiving them when necessary.

Prune came from my own need when working with a project that made nightly backups. I wanted to retain the most recent two weeks of backups, retain the Friday backups for anytime older than two weeks within the current and previous month, archive all friday backups from months earlier than the current and previous months, and remove non-friday backups older than two weeks.

Prune is easy to [use](use.html) and [configurable](configure.html) if your own retention policy doesn't match mine. It's released under the [unlicense](http://unlicense.org/) (giving you lots of rights, but retaining no liability for me).
