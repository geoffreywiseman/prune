## Prune-User

I've created a [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/prune-user "Google Groups: Prune User") for users of Prune to ask questions, discuss. I doubt it's strictly necessary at this point, but better to have it before you need it than to need it before you have it.
