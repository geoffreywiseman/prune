### Release Candidate for Prune v1.2.0

Prune v1.2.0 has a release candidate, rc3. The first two I was able to quickly invalidate myself. This release includes the following:

- Explicit support for configuration with the new `--config` switch, which will copy the core retention policy to a .prune file in the specified directory, and open it for editing.
- Improved messages when no archiving necesary.
- Improved display for categories with no matching files.
- Added spec to ensure that modification time isn't the only means of categorizing files.
- Using bundler to manage dependencies.
- Improvements to code quality (thanks [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/geoffreywiseman/prune)!)
- Minor updates to dependencies for new versions of dependencies, such as Rake 10.x. (thanks [Gemnasium](https://gemnasium.com/geoffreywiseman/prune)!)
- Configured for [continuous integration](https://travis-ci.org/geoffreywiseman/prune) (thanks, Travis!)

I've updated the configuration page to address a few of these items.
