### Release Candidate 4 for Prune v1.2.0

Prune v1.2.0 has another release candidate, rc4, following [rc3](2012-11-15-prune-120-rc3.html). 

This release includes [very minor changes](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/prune-user/O0WctXi7orM), but if you're evaluating 1.2.0 before release, this is the version you should use.

I'm ready to release, but I'll wait a couple of days in case there's any surprising feedback.
