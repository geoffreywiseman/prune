# Prune
## Deleting and archiving files by date

We have some nightly processes that archive information that we'd like to retain, either for reference or 
for possible restoration.  In order to keep space usage somewhat reasonable, we'd like to prune some of
those files as they get older.  Prune satisfies that need.
